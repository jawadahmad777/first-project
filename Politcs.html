   <p> German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been re-elected for a fourth term while nationalists have made a historic surge in federal elections.
Her conservative CDU/CSU bloc has seen its worst result in almost 70 years but will remain the largest in parliament.
Its current coalition partner, the social democratic SPD, says it will go into opposition after historic losses.
The nationalist AfD has won its first seats and is set to be the third party, a result that sparked some protests.
Dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the right-wing, anti-Islam party's headquarters in Berlin on Sunday night, some with placards saying "Refugees are welcome".Protests were also held in several other cities, including Frankfurt and Cologne.</p><p>
What does the result mean for Mrs Merkel?While her alliance has remained the largest party, it is the worst result for the alliance between the Christian Democrat (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) since 1949, when national elections were held in Germany for the first time after World War Two.
It has been a long and bruising election campaign. Angela Merkel may have won the election but it does not feel like much of a victory.
This election will go down in the history books for two reasons. Mrs Merkel may have won a fourth term but it is her worst-ever general election result. And right-wing nationalists are now part of the German establishment.</p><p>
The result is a verdict, perhaps, on Mrs Merkel's decision to open Germany's doors to one million refugees.
What is the political norm in many other European countries was considered unthinkable in post-war Germany. Not any more.The most likely scenario is of a "Jamaica" coalition, so-called because of the colours of Jamaica's flag. It includes the black CDU/CSU, the yellow, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) - who are returning to parliament after a four-year hiatus - and the Greens.</p><p>
It is not a marriage made in heaven, as the Greens want to phase out 20 coal-fired power plants and the FDP disagree, but it is the only formation that would guarantee enough seats in the new Bundestag, German broadcaster ZDF says.
All parties have rejected working with the AfD.
What about the AfD?
The party is expected to take 94 seats in the 709-seat federal parliament after capitalising on a backlash against Mrs Merkel's policy towards migrants and refugees, many of them from war-torn, mainly Muslim countries like Syria.
Alternative for Germany was founded in 2013 as an anti-euro party but later turned its focus to immigration and Islam
    Angela Merkel looks set to be re-elected as German chancellor for a fourth term in office after her conservative alliance won a federal election Sunday, but the celebrations at party HQ could prove short-lived.
Germany's political system is now in a state of flux with Merkel facing an uphill battle to agree a governing coalition with other smaller parties.
In the meantime, the jobs of senior German politicians and ministers could hang in the balance as the post-election wrangling begins. CNBC looks at what will happen next.</p>
